      <p><b>What I like about GHS></b>Grafton High is a wonderful school that offers various extracurricular activities and programs tailored to students' interests and passions. Personally, I take great pleasure in attending events like carnivals, pep rallies, and homecoming, which not only allow me to have fun and connect with my peers but also showcase my school spirit and pride. Moreover, I am extremely satisfied with my participation in academic clubs such as the Science Honors Society and the Math Honors Society, which provide me with a platform to learn, improve as a student, engage in intellectually stimulating conversations, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Additionally, the teachers and staff at Grafton High School are highly competent, approachable, and dedicated to ensuring students' success. Their unwavering support and guidance have played a crucial role in my academic development, and I am grateful for their commitment to helping students achieve their objectives. Overall, I value the sense of community and inclusivity fostered by Grafton High School, as well as the various opportunities it offers students to learn, socialize, and explore their interests.</p>
      <p><b>My Leadership Skills:</b>I believe that I possess excellent leadership skills, which make me an ideal candidate for the SCA. I have demonstrated my ability to effectively communicate with my peers, actively listen to their concerns, and provide practical solutions to address them. Additionally, I have exhibited a willingness to collaborate with others and assume responsibilities, which are essential qualities for a leader. My positive attitude, empathy, and dedication to helping others make me an excellent candidate for the position, and I have no doubt that I will excel in leading the SCA and representing the student body.</p>
