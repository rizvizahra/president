The carnivals, pep rallies, and homecoming not only allow me to have fun and connect with my peers but also showcase my school spirit and pride. Moreover, I am quite satisfied with my participation in various clubs which provide me with a platform to learn, and improve as a student. Additionally, the teachers and staff at GHS are amazing, approachable, and dedicated to ensuring students' success.</p>
      <p><b>What are your strengths as a leader</b>My ability to effectively communicate with my peers, actively listen to their concerns, and provide practical solutions to address them. My willingness to collaborate with others and assume responsibilities, which are essential qualities for a leader. My positive attitude, empathy, and dedication to helping others make me an excellent candidate for the position.</p>
